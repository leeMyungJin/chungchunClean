Labeled Input
=============

Use the **wj-labeled-input** CSS class to create Android-style input elements
with floating labels.

Elements with the **wj-labeled-input** class contain an input control 
(or a regular input element) and a label that moves over the input element
when it is empty and out of the way when the input is filled.
They may also contain an element with the **wj-error** class.
If present, this element displays field validation errors.

The **wj-labeled-input** class also provides custom styling for check boxes
and radio buttons.
