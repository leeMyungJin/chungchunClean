Edit and Persist Views
======================

Views in the [PivotEngine](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_olap.pivotengine.html) are defined by the [viewDefinition](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_olap.pivotengine.html#viewdefinition) property.

You can use the engine's [viewDefinition](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_olap.pivotengine.html#viewdefinition) property to persist views as application settings.

This sample shows how you can select pre-defined views, edit the current view with the [PivotPanel](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_olap.pivotpanel.html), and save views to be loaded later.
