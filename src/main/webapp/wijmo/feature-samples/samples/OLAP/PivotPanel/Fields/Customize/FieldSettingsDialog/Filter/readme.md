Edit & Filter Fields in OLAP
===============================

Each field has its own configuration. You can edit fields from the [PivotPanel's](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_olap.pivotpanel.html) context menu. Right-click any field on the panel and select the "Field Settings..." option. This will bring up a dialog where you can edit the field's properties, including the filter. You can also do this from the [PivotGrid](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_olap.pivotgrid.html) on the right.
