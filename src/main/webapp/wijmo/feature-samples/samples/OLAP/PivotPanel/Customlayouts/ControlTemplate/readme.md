PivotPanel Layout
=================================

The [PivotPanel](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_olap.pivotpanel.html) control has a Stacked layout that shows the Fields Section above the Areas Section. This is the default layout used by Excel as well. This sample replaces the [PivotPanel's](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_olap.pivotpanel.html) default [controlTemplate](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_olap.pivotpanel.html#controltemplate) with one that uses a CSS Grid-based layout. This allows you to achieve virtually any layout you want simply by adjusting a few CSS rules.
