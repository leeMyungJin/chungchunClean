Filter Fields
=============

The [PivotEngine](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_olap.pivotengine.html) has several field collections exposed as properties [filterFields](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_olap.pivotengine.html#filterfields) contain fields that are used only for filtering the data. They are not included in the output summary. The [filterFields](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_olap.pivotengine.html#filterfields) list allows you to apply filters based on fields that are not being used as measures or dimensions.
