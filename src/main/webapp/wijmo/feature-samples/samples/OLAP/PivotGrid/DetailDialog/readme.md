Detail Dialog Customization
===========================

The [PivotGrid](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_olap.pivotgrid.html) allows you to drill-down into cells to see the data items that were used to calculate each summary. Users can invoke the detail dialog by double-clicking any value cell. You can also invoke the detail dialog by calling the grid's [showDetail](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_olap.pivotgrid.html#showdetail) method and passing the coordinates of the cell.
