Row Height
==========

By default, [FlexGrid](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.flexgrid.html) computes row heights based on the font size and a default cell padding which is set to three pixels in the 'wijmo.css' file. You can change this default easily by specifying a different padding for the cells using CSS. This is a good approach because it applies to cells in all grid panels and does not require any code.
