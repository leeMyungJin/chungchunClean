Overflowing Cells
=================

This sample shows how you can implement [FlexGrid](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.flexgrid.html) with cells that show all their 
content when the mouse hovers over them.

This behavior is useful in grids where some cells contain entries that are too long to fit the cells. This is done with pure CSS.
