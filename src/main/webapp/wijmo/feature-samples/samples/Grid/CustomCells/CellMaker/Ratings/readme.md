CellMaker Ratings
=================

The [CellMaker](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_cellmaker.cellmaker.html) class provides a simple way to create custom cells of common types within a FlexGrid.

This sample shows how to use the [CellMaker](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_cellmaker.cellmaker.html) class to create ratings cells,
which shows values within a given range as a series of stars. 

The [CellMaker.makeRating](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_cellmaker.cellmaker.html#makerating) method takes arguements for setting the range of the rating, as well as the label to be displayed. Ratings cells can be read-only or 
editable, in which case users may change ratings by clicking on the stars or by using the keyboard.

You may customize the appearance of the rating symbols using CSS. The sample below shows how you can do this for a specific column, replacing the default orange stars
with green circles.
