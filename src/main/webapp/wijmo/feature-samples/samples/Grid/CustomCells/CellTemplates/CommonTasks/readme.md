Common Cell Template Tasks
==========================

This sample shows how you can accomplish two of the most common
tasks for cell templates: conditional formatting and images.

All versions of the sample show how you can accomplish these tasks
using the [Column.cellTemplate](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.column.html#celltemplate) property.

The framework-specific versions also show how you can do the same
thing using cell template directives, which are more powerful but
slightly more complex.
