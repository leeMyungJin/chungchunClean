CellMaker Images
================

The [CellMaker](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_cellmaker.cellmaker.html) class provides a simple way to create custom cells of common types within a FlexGrid.

This sample shows how to use the [CellMaker](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_cellmaker.cellmaker.html) class to create cells with images.

The [CellMaker.makeImage](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_cellmaker.cellmaker.html#makeimage) method gets the image's URL from the column binding.
It allows you to set a label expression which is applied to the image element's "alt"
attribute, which is important for accessibility.

You may also specify a handler for the image's click event.
