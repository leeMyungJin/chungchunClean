CellMaker Sparklines
====================

The [CellMaker](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_cellmaker.cellmaker.html) class provides a simple way to create custom cells of common types.

This sample shows how to use the [CellMaker](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_cellmaker.cellmaker.html) class to create cells with sparklines.

Sparklines are small charts used to show trends in a series of values, such as
seasonal increases or decreases, economic cycles, or to highlight maximum and minimum
values. 

The [CellMaker.makeSparkline](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_cellmaker.cellmaker.html#makesparkline) method gets the chart data from the column binding. 
It allows you to set choose the type of sparkline (line, column, or win/loss), markers you want to display and label expression to improve accessibility.
