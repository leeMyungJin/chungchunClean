Sizing and Auto Sizing
======================

By default, the [FlexGrid](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.flexgrid.html) control sets its height automatically to fit its content.

In most cases, however, you will want to limit the grid's height using CSS. In this case, the grid will automatically show scrollbars as needed and will virtualize the content to improve performance.
