Auto-Size Rows Asynchronously
=============================

Auto-sizing all rows on a [FlexGrid](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.flexgrid.html) control with a lot of data is a time-consuming process. This sample demonstrates how you can auto-size rows asynchronously to improve performance. The code listens to events and auto-sizes only rows that are currently in view and have not been auto-sized yet.
