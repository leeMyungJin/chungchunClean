Deferred Resizing
=================

By default, the [FlexGrid](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.flexgrid.html) control resizes rows and columns as the user drags the mouse.

Setting the [deferResizing](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.flexgrid.html#deferresizing) property to true causes the grid to show a marker instead, and resize the row or column only when the user releases the mouse button. This may improve performance on grids that have a large number of columns.
