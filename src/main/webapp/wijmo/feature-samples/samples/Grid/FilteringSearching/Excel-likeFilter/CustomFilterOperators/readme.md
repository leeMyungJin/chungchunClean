Custom Filter Operators
=======================

The [FlexGridFilter](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_filter.flexgridfilter.html) class is localizable, and you can take advantage of that 
not only to customize the strings displayed in the UI, but also which filter 
conditions to show for each data type.

In this example, we customized the list of operators by assigning custom arrays 
to the filter's **stringOperators**, **numberOperators**, **dateOperators**, 
and **booleanOperators**. Open the filter drop-downs to see the effect.
