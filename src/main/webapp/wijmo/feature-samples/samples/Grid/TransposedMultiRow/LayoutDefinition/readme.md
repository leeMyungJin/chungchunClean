Layout Definition
===============

The [TransposedMultiRow](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_transposedmultirow.transposedmultirow.html) control extends the [FlexGrid](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.flexgrid.html) control 
to display data using a transposed layout, where columns represent data items 
and rows represent item properties like in the [TransposedGrid](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_transposed.transposedgrid.html) control.

But in contrast to the [TransposedGrid](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_transposed.transposedgrid.html) control, the [TransposedMultiRow](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_transposedmultirow.transposedmultirow.html) control
uses multiple columns to represent each data item.

Like the [MultiRow](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_multirow.multirow.html) control, The [TransposedMultiRow](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_transposedmultirow.transposedmultirow.html) control also allows to customize
layout using the property [layoutDefinition](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_transposedmultirow.transposedmultirow.html#layoutdefinition). This property has the same meaning and usage
as in the [MultiRow](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_multirow.multirow.html) control although the resulting view will looks differently
because of transposing.

This sample demonstrates the differences between the [TransposedMultiRow](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_transposedmultirow.transposedmultirow.html) and 
the [MultiRow](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_multirow.multirow.html) controls that have the same layout definition.
