Styling Records, Groups, and Cells
==================================

In many applications, you may want to show where each record and group starts or ends.

The [MultiRow](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_multirow.multirow.html) control enables this by adding CSS class names to cell elements in the
first and last row/column of each group. The class names are `wj-record-start`, `wj-record-end`, `wj-group-start`, and `wj-group-end`.

You can also use the standard **cssClass** property to customize the appearance of specific cells.
