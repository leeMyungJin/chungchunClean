Accessibility Extender
======================

The [FlexGrid](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.flexgrid.html) control has extensive [built-in accessibility support](https://www.grapecity.com/blogs/flexgrid-accessibility). But there are situations where you may want to extend that and provide additional support that is specific to your application or user base. This sample has an AccessibilityExtender class that shows how to add your own app-specific accessibility features.
