Event-Based Validation
======================

The FlexGrid helps with validation in several ways.

**Automatic Type Coercion**, **Data Maps**, **Event-Based Validation**, and
**CollectionView-Based Validation**.

The grid below demonstrates the three first items. It has a Country column with
a data map that prevents users from entering invalid countries.
The [cellEditEnding](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.flexgrid.html#celleditending) event is used to ensure that the 'Sales' and 'Expenses'
columns contain positive values.
