Inline Editing
==============

Although the FlexGrid control provides efficient, Excel-style editing by default, you may want to customize the editing behavior. If for some reason you don't like the Excel-style editing and prefer to add editing buttons to every row (typical of editable HTML tables), you can accomplish that using the [formatItem](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.flexgrid.html#formatitem) event and a little code.
