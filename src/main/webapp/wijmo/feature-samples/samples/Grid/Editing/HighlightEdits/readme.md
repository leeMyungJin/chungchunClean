Highlight Edits
===============

This sample shows how you can highlight cells that have been edited.

The sample uses an **EditHighlighter** class that keeps track of the original
values for cells that have been edited or pasted, and highlights them by
applying a custom CSS class to the cells.

If you restore a cell's original value, the highlight is removed.
