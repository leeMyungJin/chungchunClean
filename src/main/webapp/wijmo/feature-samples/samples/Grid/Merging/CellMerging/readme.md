Cell Merging
============

The FlexGrid control supports content-driven cell merging. To enable cell merging, set the [allowMerging](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.flexgrid.html#allowmerging) property to indicate what part or parts of the grid you want to merge, and set the [allowMerging](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.flexgrid.html#allowmerging) property on specific rows and columns to true. Once you do that, the grid will merges cells that have the same content, grouping the data visually.
