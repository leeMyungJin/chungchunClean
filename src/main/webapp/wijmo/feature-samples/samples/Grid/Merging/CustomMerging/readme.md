Custom Merging
==============

By default, FlexGrid applies merging to cells based on their content.

In some cases, you may want to use different strategies for merging.
You can achieve this by defining a class that extends the [wijmo.grid.MergeManager](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.mergemanager.html)
class and assigning an object of that type to the grid's [mergeManager](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.flexgrid.html#mergemanager) property.
