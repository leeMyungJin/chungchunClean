Row Groups
=============

This sample shows how you can create row groups by initializing the grid's
[rowGroups](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_transposed.transposedgrid.html#rowgroups) collection with an array of hierarchical elements where 
rows may have a rows property containing child rows.

The row groups may be collapsible and configured to show any of the child
rows when the group is collapsed.

You can use CSS to animate the row groups as they expand or collapse.
