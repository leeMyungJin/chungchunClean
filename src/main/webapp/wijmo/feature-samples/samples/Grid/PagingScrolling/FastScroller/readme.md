Fast Scroller (iOS-style)
=========================

The iPad contact list uses a fast scroller to make it easier to look up people by clicking their initials. This sample implements something similar with FlexGrid by adding a vertical list of initials near the right edge of a grid. When users click or type an initial, the grid scrolls to show the first contact that matches the request.
