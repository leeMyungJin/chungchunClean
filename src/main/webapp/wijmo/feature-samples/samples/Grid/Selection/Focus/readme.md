Selection and Focus
===================

You can use the 'wj-state-focused' pseudo-class to improve accessibility 
on your FlexGrid controls. 

For example, the grid below shows the selection in grey when it does not 
contain the focus, and adds an orange outline to the selected cell when 
the grid does have the focus.
