Checkbox-based Selection
========================

Use FlexGrid's [Selector](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_selector.selector.html) class to add a checkbox-based scheme for row selection.

This selection scheme works great on mobile devices, which have no keyboards
with shift and control keys which are normally used to create extended
selections.

The [Selector](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_selector.selector.html) class works with flat and hierarchical views. When used with
hierarchical views, users can toggle the selected state for entire groups at
once.

The [Selector](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_selector.selector.html) class can be used on header columns as well as on regular 
scrollable/data columns.
