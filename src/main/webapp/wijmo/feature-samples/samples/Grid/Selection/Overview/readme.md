Selection
=========

By default, the FlexGrid control allows you to select a range of cells with the mouse or keyboard, just like Excel. The [selectionMode](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.flexgrid.html#selectionmode) property allows you to change that so that users are restricted to selecting rows, row ranges, non-contiguous rows (like in a list-box), single cells, or nothing at all.
