Dragging Rows from the FlexGrid
===============================

You can use the HTML5 drag/drop API to implement row dragging from, into, or between [FlexGrid](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.flexgrid.html) controls. This simple example shows how you can drag rows from the grid into arbitrary elements. You can easily extend this to support move operations (by removing the row from the source grid when the operation is completed) or dropping into grids (by detecting the drop position and inserting new rows into the target grid).
