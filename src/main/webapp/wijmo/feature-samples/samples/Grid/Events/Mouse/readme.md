Mouse Events
============

To handle mouse events, add a listener to the [FlexGrid](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.flexgrid.html) contrl's **hostElement** and use the [hitTest](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.flexgrid.html#hittest) method to determine which grid panel and cell were clicked. The grid below has a handler attached to the 'mousemove' event, and shows information about the element under the mouse.
