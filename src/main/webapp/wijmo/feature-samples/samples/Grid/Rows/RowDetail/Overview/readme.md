Row Details
===========

Sometimes rows are bound to data objects that contain more information 
than would fit easily on a regular grid.

In these scenarios, you may want to use the [FlexGridDetailProvider](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_detail.flexgriddetailprovider.html)
class that is included with the [wijmo.grid.detail](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/modules/wijmo_grid_detail.html) module. The FlexGridDetailProvider will create a details section for each row that users can expand to see the rest of the data.

You can add anything you want to the detail row, including other grids. The sample below shows both how to display the data in another grid, as well as within standard HTML elements.
