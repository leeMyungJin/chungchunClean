Lazy-Loaded Trees
=================

In the TreeGrid below, collapsed nodes have a single dummy child. When a node is expanded, more nodes are loaded on demand. This is a common pattern known as 'lazy-loading', and is done by utilizing the [groupCollapsedChanged](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid.flexgrid.html#groupcollapsedchanged) event.
