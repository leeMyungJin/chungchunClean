Custom UIs
============================

The [FlexGridFilter](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_grid_filter.flexgridfilter.html) class is localizable, and you can take advantage of that to customize its UI by modifying the strings shown to users and also the lists of conditions and operators. In this sample, we customized the list of operators by assigning custom arrays to the filter's **stringOperators**, **numberOperators**, **dateOperators**, and **booleanOperators**.
