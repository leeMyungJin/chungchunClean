Bar With Line
======================

Each series object in the [FlexChart](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html) control may specify its own [chartType](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html#charttype) to override the chart's default. This makes it easy to mix different chart types in a single chart.
The sample shows combination a bar chart with line chart, and multiple Y axes.
