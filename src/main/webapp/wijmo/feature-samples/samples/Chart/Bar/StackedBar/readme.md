Stacked Bar
===========

This sample shows stacking applied to a [FlexChart](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html) bar chart, which is similar to a rotated column chart.

To stack the chart values, you'll need to set the [stacking](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html#stacking) property of [FlexChart](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html).

By default, items on the Y axis start from the bottom of the chart, so the first items appear at the bottom and the last at the top.

If you reverse the Y axis, items will start at the top of the, which is often a more natural order.
