Column With Error Bars
======================

The [ErrorBar](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart_analytics.errorbar.html) class extends the regular [Series](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.series.html) class to provide error bars that can be added on top of the regular series data.

The sample shows a [FlexChart](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html) with a single series column with error bars.
