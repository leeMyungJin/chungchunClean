Column with Drill-down
======================

The [FlexChart](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html) control supports the implementation of drill-down charts. This column chart uses [FlexChart's](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html) [selectionChanged](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html#selectionchanged) event to determine which column the user has clicked on, and then updates the chart's [itemsSource](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html#itemssource) with new data, as well as changing the chart's color to show that new data is being displayed.
