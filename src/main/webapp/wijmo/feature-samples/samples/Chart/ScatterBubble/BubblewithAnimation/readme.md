Wealth Health
=============

This sample shows a [FlexChart](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html) that shows the evolution of income, life expectancy, and population in 178 nations over a period of 210 years. Slide the gauge or press the play button and enjoy the show. Try clicking a bubble to track a country's evolution through the animation.

This is a Wijmo version of [Mike Bostock's sample in D3](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/nations/), which is based on Gapminder’s [Wealth & Health of Nations](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/?from=world#$chart-type=bubbles), made famous by Hans Rosling’s memorable [2006 TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen).
