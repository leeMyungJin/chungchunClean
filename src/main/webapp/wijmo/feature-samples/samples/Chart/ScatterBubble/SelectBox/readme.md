Select Box
========================

This sample demonstrates how you can implement multi-point selection on a [FlexChart](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html) control. Dragging on the chart will clear the currently selected points and select a new set of points that lie within the drag area. clicking on a point will also toggle its selection state, while clicking on an empty portion of the chart will clear the current selection.
