Waterfall
=========

[Waterfall](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart_analytics.waterfall.html) charts help in understanding the cumulative effect of sequentially introduced positive or negative values. The Waterfall chart is also known as a "flying bricks" chart or Mario chart due to the apparent suspension of columns in mid-air.

This sample shows how to create a Waterfall chart, as well as how to use the [connectorLines](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart_analytics.waterfall.html#connectorlines) property to connect the bars and the total increase/decrease of the chart using the [showTotal](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart_analytics.waterfall.html#showtotal) property.
