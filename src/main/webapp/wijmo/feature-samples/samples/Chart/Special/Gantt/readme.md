Gantt
===============

Gantt charts illustrate project schedules. They show the start and finish dates of each task and typically add information such as the completion state of each task and dependencies between tasks. In this sample, we assign the **gantItemFormatter()** method to the [itemFormatter](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html#itemformatter) property and the **ganttChartRendered()** method to the [rendered](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html#rendered) event to create a Gantt chart using [FlexChart](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html).
