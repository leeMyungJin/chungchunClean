Funnel Chart
=============

[Funnel Charts](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/enums/wijmo_chart.charttype.html#funnel) show values along multiple stages in a process.

For example, you could use a funnel chart to show the number of sales prospects at each stage in a sales pipeline. Typically, the values decrease gradually, making the bars resemble a funnel.
