Multiple Plot Areas
==============

Stacking [FlexChart](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html) controls is an alternative to creating a single chart with multiple plot areas. Use the [plotMargin](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html#plotmargin) property to ensure the charts line up properly.

For example, these two charts are stacked vertically have their Y axes aligned by setting both [plotMargin](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html#plotmargin) properties to have '120' as the left value.
