Stacked Plot Areas
=============

Stacking [FlexChart](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html) controls is an alternative to creating a single chart with multiple plot areas. Use the [plotMargin](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html#plotmargin) property to ensure the charts line up properly.

This sample shows three charts are stacked vertically, as well as a [Range Selector](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart_interaction.rangeselector.html) and a [Line Marker](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.linemarker.html).
