Selection
======================

This sample demonstrates how to allow users to select either individual points in [FlexChart](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html), or select entire series. You can set how users can select data from [FlexChart](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html) by setting the [selectionMode](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html#selectionmode) property.
