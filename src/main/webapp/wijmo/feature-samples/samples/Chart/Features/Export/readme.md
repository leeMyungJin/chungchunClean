Saving charts as images for inclusion in other documents is a common requirement. Some browsers support this as a context menu option, but not all.

The [FlexChart](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html) control's [saveImageToFile](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html#saveimagetofile) method makes this really easy.
