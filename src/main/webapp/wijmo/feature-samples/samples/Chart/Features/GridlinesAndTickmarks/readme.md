Gridlines and Tickmarks
=======================

By default, [FlexChart](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html) uses horizontal lines to show the x-axis and major gridlines along the y-axis. This makes charts clean and easy-to-read.

You can change this by modifying the [axisX](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html#axisx) and [axisY](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html#axisy) properties. This example shows how you create and control major and minor gridlines along both axes, and how to customize them using CSS.
