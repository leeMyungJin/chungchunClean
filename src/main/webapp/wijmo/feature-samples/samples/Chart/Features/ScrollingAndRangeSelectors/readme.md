Scrolling & Range Selectors
===========================

Viewing large charts can be difficult in compact user interfaces. [FlexChart](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html) allows the use of AxisScrollbar to give you an option of adding scrollbar to the axis of the chart.

This sample allows you to view the chart with the scrollbars on X and Y axis of the chart.
