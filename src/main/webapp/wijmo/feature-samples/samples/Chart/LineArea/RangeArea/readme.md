Range Area
==========

This sample shows how to display a range area inside of the [FlexChart](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html) control. 

We'll use the raw data that is going to be displayed to calculate what two range areas we will use. We then add them to the chart's [series](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html#series) property, and then set the series areas' [style](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.seriesbase.html#style) property to designate how the range area will be displayed.
