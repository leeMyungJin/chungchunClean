Aggregate Date Series
======================

This sample shows how the [FlexChart](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html) control can use different aggregates when displaying data within the chart. Here we create a custom component called **AggregateSeries**, which we then use to set Wijmo's [Aggregate](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/enums/wijmo.aggregate.html) Enum.
