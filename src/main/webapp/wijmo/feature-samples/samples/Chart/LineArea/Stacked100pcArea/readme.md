Stacked 100% Area
======================

This sample shows how to display a stacked area 100% [FlexChart](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html). This is done by setting the [stacking](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html#stacking) property to [Stacked100pc](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/enums/wijmo_chart.stacking.html#stacked100pc). This will set the chart to display how each value contributes to the total with the relative size of each series representing its contribution to the total.
