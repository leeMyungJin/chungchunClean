Dynamic Line Chart
======================

The [FlexChart](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html) control receives notifications when the data changes and updates the chart automatically. The sample shows dynamic line chart that updates automatically

The chart below is bound to an [itemsSource](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_chart.flexchart.html#itemssource) that receives new items at a given interval. When new items are added to the data source, old items are removed to keep the total item count constant. The result is a dynamic scrolling chart.
